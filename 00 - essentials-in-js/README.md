# üìùEssentials in Java Script

Thus Java Script is the browser's programming language. It is widely used for various purposes and things like Front-End and Back-End Technologies in both Mobile and Web Applications development. So, today we are planning to build a strong and simple understanding about JS. Here in this session we are going to get some basic and fundamentals of js to get start with some of the important and crucial parts of the course.

## Topics Covered:

Following are the topics covered in today's session

- Java Script introduction
- console in the Browser
- Data Types in JS
- Variable Declaration Types
- Basic Operators in JS
- Type Conversion and Coercion
- Condition Statement \[if/else if/else\]
- Exercise #1 - Calculate the BMI Value
- Exercise #2 - Calculate the Leap Year
- Exercise #3 - Build a Fizz Buzz Logic

## Take aways

- Integrating the Script JS file to a Browser or HTML file.
- Browser Console
- Data Types and Variable Declarations
- Basic Operators in JS.
- Coercion and Conversion
- Truthy and Falsy Values
- Condition Statements and their Flow

## Theoretical Concepts

What is JS?

- Java script is defined as a programming language which is object-oriented, multi-paradigm, high-level programming language.
- High-level languages are programming languages that are used for writing code that has the capacity of memory management also has higher level syntax.
- Object-oriented programming is simply a programming way which uses objects or entities of a class. More about this in future
- Multi-paradigm programming is one of the feature is JS that enables various styles of programming such Imperative and Declarative Programming.

  üìí _Imperative_: The flow of execution in the code consists of a sequence of commands for the computer to perform. Eg: C Python

  üìí _Declarative_: Declarative programming is when you write your code in such a way that it describes what you want to do, and not how you want to do it. It is left up to the compiler to figure out the how. Eg: SQL

What are Data Types?

- Data Types: It is the categorization of the data being sent to the computer memory from the translator. Such data can be of different types such as integer, string, booleans etc...
- Operators and Operands: The operators are simply the expression builders or characters which themselves has the capacity to process the values or in other hand operands.

Define Type Conversion and Coercion.

- Type Conversion - Explicit conversion one data to another data type is called as Type Conversion.
- Type Coercion - Implicit conversion of one data getting changed to another form is called as Type Coercion.

Decision or Conditional Statements.

- Conditional Statement: Statements check whether a given data or condition returns true or false and accordingly as we defined in the control structures.

```
if (condition){

    <!-- code to be executed -->

} else if (condition) {

 <!-- code to be executed -->

} else {

<!-- code to be executed -->

}
```
